<p>From my childhood I am a big fan of chess. I found it so interesting to play. At the beginning I used to think that you need to be intelligent in order to be good at chess. But when I started playing it more often and became good at it, I learned that you don't need to be some genious in order to a good chess player. I started with playing chess in board with my friends, then overtime I became better than them. After that I created an account in <a>chess.com</a>. Then when I played a couple of games, I understood that I am very bad at chess. I started watching youtube videos about how to get good at chess. I came across a channel named Gothamchess. I watched his playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBRObSmbZluSo6h0AySyeZRdlQzEhr2XL">How to win at chess</a> and his many other opening tutorials like traxler, vienna gambit, caro-kann. When I started watching it, at first it was difficult for me to learn and use them, but over time I became good at these openings. After crossing 500 rating points, I started using caro-kann in almost every single game. At first I almost won all my games with caro-kann as my opponents were unfamiliar with this defence and played bad moves, but later it was difficult for me to continue this streak of winning every single caro-kann game as opponents were familiar with this opening and they were playing the engine moves which they have prepared. At present my favourite openings are Italian and Evans gambit (But I still many of my games as black with caro-kann). When I crossed 1000, I started visualizing chess coordinates and now I can easily visualize them. BTW now I don't play in chess.com as I think its too bloated and I like minimal, so I switched to <a>lichess.org</a>. Overthere my rapid rating is 1200+ (its the rating when I am writing this article, it may increase or decrease with time). You can see my username in the contacts section. And yes my favourite type of match is rapid as its neither too long nor too short. I normally like playing 10 min rapid.</p>

<h3 id="tips-to-get-good-at-chess">Tips to get good at chess</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn the basic rules before learning openings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play rapid or classic rather than bullet as you have time to calculate moves in rapid and classic whereas in bullet you just blindly make a move because of time shortage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anaylize your games rather than just blindly playing (most important)</p>
</li>
</ul>
