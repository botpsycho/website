  <h1 class="title">What softwares do I use</h1>
  
</div>
<p>When it comes to softwares I try my best to use only free and open source softwares. I don't like using proprietary softwares as I don't trust big corporations. I believe that companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple try to spy on us. So I also recommend you to use only free and open source softwares.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-my-choices">These are my choices:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating System - I use <span style="color:blue;">linux</span>. Its just great. Highly customizable, secure and stable. Free BSD is also good but the only problem is software availability. Some softwares which are not meant for linux can still be somehow used by wine and linux also has a good availability of software itself. So thats mainly why I chose linux over Free BSD. BTW I use <span style="color:blue;">archlinux</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Browser - Unfortunately when it comes to web browsers we don't have any great options. The one I use is <span style="color:blue;">Brave</span>. Its a okay browser. Its far more better than Google chrome and Microsoft edge browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminal - I like minimal terminals so I use <span style="color:blue;">st</span> (suckless's simple terminal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shell - I use zsh as a shell. It has pretty much all of the features of bash with additional plugins for more advanced auto-completion and syntax coloring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text editor - I love <span style="color:blue;">vim</span> when it comes to text editor. Its light, highly customizable and clean. I don't use emacs as I can do all those things already in vim, so didn't felt its worth switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Window manager - I use <span style="color:blue;">dwm</span>. Its mininal and compatible with pywal (a program which generates themes based on your wallpaper) which is a must for me. Occasionally I use xmonad which is also minmal but unfortunately not compatible with pywal. For status bar I use my custom script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image viewer - <span style="color:blue;">sxiv</span> is my only choice. Its by far the best image viewer I have ever seen. Like my most other programs its minimal and is highy customizable. The best part about it is it can run scripts (like in my config if I press &quot;CONTROL + x and then w it will set the image as wallpaer, CONTROL + x and then d will delete it&quot; etc) .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video player - I don't like vlc as its too bloated, I wanted to use something simple so I use <span style="color:blue;">mpv</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music player - I use <span style="color:blue;">mpv</span>. Its very easy to use, lightweight and very customizable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PDF viewer - I use <span style="color:blue;">zathura</span> for viewing my pdf. Its also very light weight and customizable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File manager - Mostly I manage my files through commands but occasionally I use <span style="color:blue;">lf</span>, which is terminal based file manager (it's a fork of ranger).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSS reader - I don't like terminal based RSS readers so I use a GUI RSS reader, its name is <span style="color:blue;">fluent reader</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email client - I use <span style="color:blue;">thunderbird</span> to manage my emails. I know its old and doesn't have a good user interface but I don't want to switch as I don't want to use my energy on getting used to another email management system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note taking - Unfortunately I have tried many great free and open source note taking apps but none of them worked well for me. So I finally switched to <span style="color:blue;">notion</span> which is a proprietary note taking app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing documents - Clear choice <span style="color:blue;">Libre office</span>. I use it as its easy to use and I am very comfortable with it. I don't use terminal utilities like groff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Torrent cliet - I use <span style="color:blue;">qbittorrent</span> which is a great torrent client. Its feature rich and very easy to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual machine manager - For managing my virtual machines I use both <span style="color:blue;">virtualbox</span> and <span style="color:blue;">virt-manager</span>. Virt-manager is very fast and secure but many linux distros (which are not so famous) have resolution and performace problems on it so I also use virtualbox to test those kinds of distros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video editor - I have tried many proprietary video editors in the past but as I only use free and open source software now, I prefer <span style="color:blue;">kdenlive</span>. I think its not as good as proprietary softwares like Adobe Premier Pro and on archlinux like rolling release distros its not stable also, but I rarely edit videos and I also don't do any advance stuff so it does the job for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image editor - <span style="color:blue;">Gimp</span> is what I use. Its great. And BTW its the only image editor I know how to use so its my only option. Also I didn't require switching as it does what I want it to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media management - I use <span style="color:blue;">kodi</span> for managing my movies and tv shows. My favourite part about it is its customization. You can customize it in any way you want. You can make it look like netflix, amazon prime, emby or any other platform. You also get many great other plugins to choose from.</p>
</li>
